# HarleCDTRedTeamTool
A red team tool designed for CDT Homework 3

Installation:

In order for the tool to run as intended, the target device must have python installed and the python module pynput 
installed. 

The file for the tool must be present on the target device for it to run. The tool can be run on the command
line by typing "python WillHarleCDTRedTeamTool.py"

Usage:

Once the tool has been run, it will create the directory specified to store the log file and will log the keys that have 
been hit since the script has been run. If you are specifying that the log file should be stored in a path that does not 
exist, the tool will make that directory and store the file there as well.
